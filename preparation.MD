What you need to do before you can start setting your rogue AP up

--> Note: Since there were not many available Wi-Fi adapters and none of these compatible with Kali Linux, I've gone with this setup:
    Raspberry Pi 4B with 4GB RAM (minimum including 32GB SD-Card, HDMI adapter and power supply)
    Parrot OS 64bit security version (https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/iso/6.4/Parrot-security-6.4_rpi.img.xz)
    WiFi-Adapter BrosTrend AC650
If you're more up for working with Kali Linux, feel free to to so!

1. Download Raspberry Pi Imager for your OS -> https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
2. Install Parrot or Kali on your Raspberry Pi:
    Choose your model, OS and SD-card. Some OS are ready to choose from the imager. If you like your own download of your OS, you can always choose "own image" in the drop down menu. I recommend modifying the configuration to your home WiFi and if possible, enable SSH.
